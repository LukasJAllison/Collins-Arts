00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.661
I bet you didn't know that 
I could rap did ya?

00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:18.471
I bet ya didn't know that
I got tracks did ya?

00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:21.229
I only do it cause you didn't
think I can did ya?

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.929
I'm just a teacher with a plan tryin' 
to plant some seeds up in ya, heart.

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.277
Cause from the start when we were kids
we were making art.

00:00:28.277 --> 00:00:31.402
Pour out all our feelings on the page
tryin' to make our mark.

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:34.437
Said we need to stop the games
we can't reach the stars.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.569
Can't forget the day they told us 
grow up life is hard.

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:51.759
But that's where I come in, 
just to mend, need a friend?

00:00:52.054 --> 00:00:55.134
Let me lend a helping hand 
I'll always be there when I can.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.832
Just as long as I am able, set em down
lay your burdens on the table.

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:03.524
Pick up a brush, or a pen, then begin
to put your feelings on the page again.

00:01:04.062 --> 00:01:07.242
Don't be scared, yeah it's hard,
but it's worth it in the end.

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:09.873
Expression is God's gift to men.

00:01:10.772 --> 00:01:12.952
Just let yourself create again.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.983
I bet you didn't guess that
I'm all love did ya?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.953
I bet you didn't know that
you're enough did ya?

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.012
My heart is pouring out it's nothin' 
but this love for ya.

00:01:22.447 --> 00:01:25.887
I'm just a teacher with a plan,
Tryin' to plant some seeds up in ya.

00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:40.410
Don't be afraid, take a breath, 
it ain't about the grade.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.415
As long as something deep inside
of you is what you made.

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:47.641
I want a window to your soul so you 
can drop the facade. I'm not your moms.

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:52.076
You can be as real as real with me,
I'm not popping off. I'll call your bluff.

00:01:52.142 --> 00:01:54.959
Push you past your comfort zone
cause I never give up.

00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:58.761
Until you start growing up, but not the
way that they told you before.

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:02.175
I don't care, no matter what
I'll never show you the door.

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:04.894
You can reach the stars if 
you never ever give up.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.059
You can be a star too,
cause you shine bright enough.

00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:16.857
I bet you didn't guess that 
I'm all love did ya?

00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:20.029
I bet you didn't know that 
you're enough did ya?

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:22.811
My heart is pouring out it's
nothing but this love for ya.

00:02:22.964 --> 00:02:26.340
I'm just a teacher with a plan,
tryin' to plant some seeds up in ya.
