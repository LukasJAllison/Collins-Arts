								 <p>We don`t `fake art`.....we `make art`! We don`t trace or grid things out- we learn how to create by first learning the skills and the processes. </p>

<p>I`m Proud To Be an Art Teacher at MLCHS! Go Titans!</p>

						<h1>A little more about me...</h1>
						<p>The 2019/2020 school was my 9th year as an Art Teacher, serving 4 years in Cloverport Independent Schools in Cloverport, KY and 5 years, now, in Shelby County School District. I am originally from Bainbridge, Ohio. From 1999-2005 I lived in Indiana, South Carolina, and Virginia working as a PGA Golf Professional at various courses and clubs. In 2005, I returned to college to pursue my dream becoming an Art Teacher. I earned my BA in Fine Art from Morehead State University in 2009 and then earned my MA in Education from Georgetown College in 2011. 
<br><br>I was honored to be named the 2019 Kentucky Art Education Associations Secondary Art Educator of the Year! 
<br><br>I am currently taking classes towards my Rank 1 and will earn my MA in School Leadership and School Improvement from Campbellsville University in 2022.</P>

<p>I teach Art 1, Art 2, Art 3, and Art 4 here at MLCHS! In all of my classes, we advocate for ourselves, for causes and for issues through our artwork. We extend our classroom beyond the walls of the school and into the world, using digital resources. Community Art Projects, Fundraisers, Art Battles and Challenges, are just a few of the awesome things students do in my art classes.</p>
