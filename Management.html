					<h1> Mr. Allison's Philosophy of Education </h1>
					<p> Students should be excited and hungry to learn concepts and ideas that are new to them, as well as be able process and call upon that knowledge so that they may be able to solve problems for the betterment of society. By providing students with guidance, and the tools necessary to learn, I will help prepare them for a life beyond school. As a mentor, guide, and fellow traveler, I will teach young minds to learn and think for themselves, to question the world around them, and to create and innovate. Creation is a good thing - evident in the world around us, and students should have the ability and freedom to create things that are completely unique and original. </p>
					<p>As educators it is our job not only to help students learn and grow, but provide a safe environment, where the quest for knowledge is embraced and celebrated. There should be in all of us, a burning desire and thirst for knowledge. Unfortunately, some forms of traditional education has extinguished those passions in so many potentially bright minds. It is not our job to create a society of efficient drones. It is, however, our job to guide young minds on a path of self-discovery, free thought, and creative innovation, while instilling in them character traits that will help them use those strengths for the good of the world.</p>
					<p>The role of the school and educator should be that of a guide who takes what excites the child, an amount of things that will grow the whole child, and shows them how they can achieve a balance of life skills and knowledge. If inquisitive minds are encouraged to be curious, then while a child develops through each stage of cognition, that curiosity should only get stronger. Sometimes however, that fire inside the student has smoldered and been reduced to a mere ember - and it is in these instances that we must expose the students to a wide range of topics and subjects to find the ones that reignite their passion. This is where the role of the teacher as guide is so important and why differentiated instruction is so important to my educational philosophy.</p>
					<p>Within the Classroom Management Plan, I hope that you will gain a better picture of how I aim to help students grow. I also expect that you will get a glimpse into my classroom and find that it is a place that welcomes you, and that you will want to be! The biggest part of my educational philosophy revolves around love. Jesus tells us to love others as ourselves - and this is something that I strive to live out in the classroom. My biggest hope is that every one of my students even if they learn nothing from me in the time we are together knows that I love them and care for them individually. The reason we are educators is because we have a young generation that will eventually inherit the world, and it is our duty to show them love and kindness, and to instill in them a lifelong thirst to learn and grow.</p>
