<div class="panel">
  <p>Good classroom management comes from being proactive rather than being reactive (Harry Wong). In an attempt to create a classroom environment that is both safe and welcoming, I have classroom expectations posted, and a plan in place for when things don't work out. One of the procedures I ask students to adhere to is if they are creating a problem for another student or themselves, I will ask them to solve it. If they cannot solve it on their own, I have an Art Room Think Sheet that I use to help guide students through the process of coming up with a plan to make things right. Because of this system, we very rarely have students who have discipline issues that need to be referred to the office. This comes from a love others as myself mentality, and keeps me from reacting to issues negatively. This method of figuring out what the problem is, what some possible causes for the problem are, and working to make it right and avoid the issue in the future comes from a PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and Support) approach to student success. I always try to act with empathy first to understand where the behavior is coming from, then work to help the student come up with a way to change the behavior and prevent further issues.</p>

				<button class="accordion"><h3>Positive Behavior Interventions and Support</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
	<h3> According to an understood.com article, PBIS is a 3 tier approach to being proactive and supporting students by teaching them behavior expectations rather than reacting to unwanted behaviors in a negative way. </h3>
  <p>Tier 1: Universal, schoolwide system for everyone. All students at the school learn basic behavior expectations, like respect and kindness. School staff recognize and praise students for good behavior. Sometimes, they use small rewards, like tokens or prizes, to recognize kids.</p>

<p>Tier 2: Extra, targeted support for struggling students. Some kids have a harder time with behavior expectations. The school gives these kids evidence-based interventions and instruction. For example, some students may struggle with social interactions. A Tier 2 strategy might be providing Social Thinking® support to help them learn how to read and react to situations.</p>

<p>Tier 3: Intensive support for individual students. The third tier of PBIS is the most intensive. It’s for students who need individualized supports and services because of ongoing behavioral concerns.</p>
