				<button class="accordion"><h3>Differentiated Instruction</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Part of my overall philosophy of education is differentiated instruction. What this means for the students, is that each learner is treated as an individual with strengths and weaknesses that are unique to them. The majority of our journey together will revolve around identifying skills to improve, encouraging you to push yourself and grow, and celebrating your successes while acknowledging that there might also be failures along the way. As you will see in my rules for myself, I will always spend the majority of my time helping you see what you do well, not what you don't. I believe that when we treat students as individuals it helps them to feel valued and as active participants in their education rather than passive learners, just trying to soak up information.</p>
	<p>One of the biggest factors in a differentiated classroom is empowerment. I want to empower the learner to discover their passions and truly take ownership of their education. One of the ways I accomplish this is through a curriculum road map that is codesigned with students that helps them to achieve the required art standards, while still giving them choices and freedoms to be creative along the way. This then allows me to confer with individual students and offer supports as needed in a worshop type model of instruction (with a slight twist from the traditional methods). Videos provide the mini-lesson so that students can be at different places in their artwork at different times. The majority of class time is spent working on projects with me available to give feedback and offer support. Then there are times of reflection built in that allow students to introspect and think deeply about their progress, success, failures, and everything in between. </p>
	<p>Students are required to select and meet deadlines that match the level of effort that is typically required for a project of the chosen type. Check-ins along the way ensure that students are staying on track (and can provide me with information needed if some spurring on is required!). The individualized learning classroom can take some adjustment to get used to (because it is probably very different from your other classes), but with some guidance and support every student can take ownership of their own educational journey and be successful in growing and learning. I love to meet students where they are and help them reach for the stars. If you really put your effort into my classes, I am confident that you will see major improvements in your own skills (art or otherwise). </p>
